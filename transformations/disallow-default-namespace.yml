# this policy has been modified to use the any expression inside match. Multiple matches
# aren't needed for the selector, but this key must be added to use the any key in the
# exception rule.
# move cannot be used here because the "any" key does not exist yet. It's better to do it
# as two unique and ordered operations for more control. You can read more about this
# form of JSON patch here: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902#section-4.4
